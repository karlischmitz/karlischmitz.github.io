  <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>My name is Karli Schmitz and I am a sophomore here at UW-Madison. I am intending on majoring in strategic communication/journalism, while receiving a certificate in both sports communication and digital studies.</p>
    <p>I am originally from Sherwood, Wisconsin, which is a small town about two hours northeast of Madison. I graduated from New Holstein High School and played volleyball, basketball, and softball during all four years there. I grew up with two siblings, an older sister and older brother, and within the past six years have gained two nephews and a niece. Back home, I also have a cat named Luna.</p>
    <p>When I'm not studying or working, I enjoy working out, running, shopping, cooking, exploring new places, hanging out with friends, binge watching netflix, going to concerts and sporting events, and watching TikToks.</p>
    <p>Lastly, Go Badgers and On Wisconsin!</p>
